##################### Queues ########################
    A linear collection that adds elements to one end and removes them from
        the other in a FIFO (First In First Out) protocol.
    Queues are implemented in many ways, some based on arrays, and some based
        on linked structures.

    rear - insertions are restricted this end
    front - removals are restricted to this end

    Two fundamental operations, add and pop
        push - adds item to the rear
        pop - removes item from the front
        peek - see the item at the front of the queue
    
    There are priority queues that schedule their elements using a rating scheme
        as well as FIFO. If two elements have same rating then they are scheduled
        in FIFO order. Elements are ranked from smallest to largest according to some
        attribute like a number or char, generally smallest are removed first no matter
        when they are added to the queue. (Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm)
